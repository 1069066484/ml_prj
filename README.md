This is project of CS420-Machine Learning.

 1. Different methods are used for Fer2013 dataset's classification.
 
 2. The entrance script is 'train.py'; the codes train the model. 
 
 3. Network structures are defined in 'LeNet5.py', 'VGG_torch.py' and 'ResNet.py'.
 
 4. 'face_detect.py' contains codes that extract the face area of the image. 'Fer2013Dataset_torch.py' and 'Ldata_helper.py' contains codes related to other necessary preprocessing.
 
 5. 'summary.py' do some statistic work and 'sync.py' performs some necessary synchronization if we use Huawei cloud for training.
